This repository is primarily for new linux system administrators. 

Use freely to your own needs. No warranty provided, and I take no responsiblities for issues the scripts may cause
or for what purposes they are used for. I'm posting them simply for my own records and to make sure what I've learned
is passed on to future generations of programmers and scripters. 

If you have any questions, please direct them to palmerdl@whitman.edu.

Thanks,
